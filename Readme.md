# kidcat - <small> a new Linux command</small>
Nowadays we find that the Linux shell command `cat` which can display file content when, lack of filter and secondary qualification, may let the children accept bad information to a file. Just in such a context, I developed a new shell command `kidcat` for kids and a wide range of worried parents as a SAFER command.

## Installation and Usage
with [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/kidcat)
(if you don't have npm, go and download nodejs)
```console
sudo npm i -g kidcat
```
then
```console
kidcat <fileName>
// just the same as cat.
// eg: kidcat test.txt
```

*WELL DONE.*

You can NOW unlink your cat command if possible, uh?

It's a bit more troublesome when you catch a file, but it's **safer** for your future kids, isn't it?
